#ggsn package 
#Adds north symbols and scale bars for maps created with 'ggmap' and 'ggplot'.
#Adds north symbols (18 options) and scale bars in kilometers to maps in geographic or metric, coordinates created with 'ggplot' or 'ggmap'.
#Allows scale bar to be customized such as the legend colour, bar fix colour and text colour, font and size.
#Can change the position and the size of north symbol and scale bar.

#scale package
#Graphical scales map data to aesthetics, and provide methods for automatically determining breaks and labels for axes and legends.
#The scale package is composed of interdependent components such as palettes, transformations, bounds, scaling functions and mutables ranges.
#Palettes, pal for short, describe the useful palettes of aesthetics.
#Transformations, trans for short, describe common scale transformations, their inverses, and ways of generating breaks and labels.
#Bounds: various ways of rescaling the data
#Scaling functions: pull together palettes, bounding functions and transformations to provide a complete pathway from raw data to perceptual properties
#Mutable ranges: in many graphics pathways, scale ranges can not be computed in a single pass, but must be computed over multiple groups or multiple panels. The mutable ranges (implemented with R's new reference based class) provide a thin layer of mutability to make this task easier.
